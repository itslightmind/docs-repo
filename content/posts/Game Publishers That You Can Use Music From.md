	- Square Enix to allow monetization of Final Fantasy XIV | PCGamesN
- Kingdom Hearts ❌
	- Most of the games have strict policies, or no policies known. The only policy that i was able to find was Melody of Memory KINGDOM HEARTS Melody of Memory
	- Fine for non commercial. So sadly monetization falls under it.  
 		  "The Permitted Uses are limited to non-commercial or personal use. Standard ad revenues may be enabled for streaming."

## Activision ❌

- No shot, they've been avoiding answering if you can use they're media for over a decade.

## Bungie, Inc ❌ 📄

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed, wouldn't recommend..
- Seems like they hold the right to change the rules at any point, hopefully not retroactively

>  - Players may create videos using Destiny gameplay, which may be uploaded to third party sharing services like YouTube. If a chosen video-on-demand service enables players to monetize content, 20% of the content within the video must have been created by the player. Examples of what "player created content" may be defined as include custom commentary, animations, graphics, or gameplay

## 2K Interactive ✅

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed
- Policy on posting copyrighted 2K material – 2K Support

## MiHoYo ❌

- Seems murky, nothing is explicitly stated by developers for content creation, would strongly avoid.

## InnerSloth ✅ 📄

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed
- Seems likely that you'll be fine. They have broadcast terms for the music and sound effects broadcast. I wouldn't be surprised if its fine for Youtube
- DMCA AND FAN CREATION POLICY FOR INNERSLOTH LICENSED IP
- Terms of Use for the Games | Broadcast Rights

## Matt Makes Games Inc (Aka Celeste) ❌ 📄

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed, wouldn't recommend..
- Seems like gameplay of the game itself are SOLID, but album uploads are not.
- We haven't seen statements of using the music out of context.
- Matt Makes Games Inc. retains the right to revoke this license at any time.
- they had a previous problem back in 2018 of false claims on playthroughs of the game. Which where **TAKE DOWNS** and not simple demonization's.

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed
- Stardew Valley - Stardew monetization policy for Twitch Streamers/Youtubers/etc.

## Hollow Knight (Team Cherry) ✅ 📄

- No express permission to use it out of context, but they seem nice
	- But they're FAQ makes them seems cool
	- lots of uploads of the soundtrack so guessing its fine to use
	- FAQ — Team Cherry
- There has been a false claim but not takedown for the use of the Broken Vessel fight by a copyright troll named FILSCAP. So keep that in mind. This happened in 2021.

## Hyper Light Drifter (Heart Machine) ❌ 📄

- didn't see anything from them at all for music usage, sadly
- no one has questioned/asked at least from my research.

## Wild Frost, StarBound (Chucklefish) ✅ 📄

## The Behemoth (Castle Crashers, Battle Block Theater) ❌ 📄

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch would be Mixed
- Seems like the artists for each track owns the rights and the game is licensing them.
	- https://twitter.com/thebehemoth/status/1242219176371998720?lang=en

## Hi Res Studios (Hi-Rez Studios) ✅ 📄

- Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed
	- Source is from 2013 though couldn't find any modern policies.
- Cant find any modern copyright policies from the studio, but it seems like they're open for at least they're own gameplay packages, so it might not work for using the music out of context.
- "The Smite studio has issued a statement on YouTube streaming and monetization. "We support and encourage you, as an individual content creator, to create videos using our game content AND monetize those videos as you wish," the developer writes. Additionally, it has offered to provide written backup to any streamer that finds their videos improperly claimed."
