In [Scott Young](https://www.notion.so/Scott-Young-cc4ef1c07c264ddb9031f0e672ff6baa?pvs=21)'s article, [Fear Fizzle More Than Failure - Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/07/12/fizzle/), he notes that most projects 'fizzle out,' meaning they eventually get ignored and fail unceremoniously by default due to inattention. Young recommends that, because we learn more and grow more from failure, we should commit to our goals, so that our projects fail instead of fizzle

> Our plans don't explode, but fizzle out and are forgotten. Instead of detonating and needing to pick up the pieces, they get pushed to the back of the closet. We expect to take them back out another day, but instead they collect cobwebs.
