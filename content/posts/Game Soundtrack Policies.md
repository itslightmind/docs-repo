  * Fine for non commercial. So sadly, monetization falls under it.

If a chosen video-on-demand service enables players to monetize content, 20% of the content within the video must have been created by the player. Examples of what "player created content" may be defined as include custom commentary, animations, graphics, or gameplay

## InnerSloth ‚úÖ üìÑ

* Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed

## Hollow Knight (Team Cherry) ‚úÖ üìÑ

* No express permission to use it out of context, but they seem nice

  * [FAQ ‚Äî Team Cherry](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/faq)
* There has been a false claim but not takedown for the use of the Broken Vessel fight by a copyright troll named FILSCAP. So keep that in mind. This happened in 2021.

## Hyper Light Drifter (Heart Machine) ‚ùå üìÑ

* didn't see anything from them at all for music usage, sadly
* no one has questioned/asked at least from my research.
* People have gotten away with uploading complete OST's and singles for the last 8 years

## Wild Frost, StarBound (Chucklefish) ‚úÖ üìÑ

* Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed

## The Behemoth (Castle Crashers, Battle Block Theater) ‚ùå üìÑ

* Monetization on YouTube/Twitch would be Mixed

## Hi Res Studios (Hi-Rez Studios) ‚úÖ üìÑ

* Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed
  * Source is from 2013 though couldn't find any modern policies.
* Cant find any modern copyright policies from the studio, but it seems like they're open for at least they're own gameplay packages, so it might not work for using the music out of context.
* "The Smite studio has issued a statement on YouTube streaming and monetization. "We support and encourage you, as an individual content creator, to create videos using our game content AND monetize those videos as you wish," the developer [writes](http://www.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/home/sidebar/latest-news/view/hi-rez-studios-blog/2013/12/11/video-monetization-by-users-supported-encouraged-by-hi-rez-studios). Additionally, it has offered to provide written backup to any streamer that finds their videos improperly claimed."
* This statement is from 2013
