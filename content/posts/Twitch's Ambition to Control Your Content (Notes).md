# Twitch's Ambition to Control Your Content

--- 

## Updated Branded Content Guidelines | What Are the Changes?

1. Branded Content Disclosure Tool
	1. Not bad just an FCC requirement, it's a better tool that helps creators disclose advertisements whether they're sponsored or not.
2. Permitted and Prohibited Brand Sponsors
	1. Logos on stream can be **AT MAX** 3% of the screen
	2. No "burned in" video ads
		1. This is massive since most large content creators or events will have burned in ads.
	3. No burned in audio ads (same as above, pretty much?)
3. **Prohibited** Branded content categories
	1. Hateful products or Services
	2. Gambling content
	3. Scams
	4. Adult oriented services
	5. Weapons
	6. Tobacco
	7. ICO, PayPal loans, rich quick schemes
	8. Political content
	9. cannabis-related products

# The Most Significant Change That's Scaring Content Creators and Agencies

- This wasn't in the updated content guidelines. But it was on a adjacent postâ€¦

1. Permitted and prohibited brand sponsorship formats
	- We recognize the streamers are keen to collaborate with brands, but as outlined in the terms of service, we maintain the exclusive right to sell, serve, and display advertisements on the Twitch Services. This means that you may not insert, embed, or "burn in" prerecorded advertising units into your livestream.

## This is what Scared Every Agency & Streamer

- This would stop major events like Ludwig's Chess Boxing or something like Creator Clash from happening. Because without the burned in ads, they wouldn't have been able to afford the even itself.

# Twitch Attempts to Walk back on Twitter

- After general push back, Twitch attempts to push back on Jun 6, 2023. With a message stating "Today's branded content policy update was overly broad. This created confusion and frustration, and we apologize for that."
- response from the community was NOT good.

# Twitch's Goal

- twitch's main goal is to target agency's that work through twitch streamers. since when agencies advertise through twitch they don't see a cut of the money. With the changes they made, they're goal is to kill agencies from operating on twitch. 
- with the main goal being - having the twitch streamers advertise and come to Twitch as if they were an agency. they're trying to pitch brand opportunities from agencies that work related to twitch.
- They want to gain more of the ecosystem and major productions to work with twitch.
- Push Small Platforms Running Burn-ins Out
	- An example of one of these platforms is <https://getstream.com>. 
		- By cutting these platforms Twitch is again forcing the major brands to go to them - while simultaneously destroying the source of income for smaller streamers.
		- Twitch Can not run/deal with all brand deals on the platform.

# Reason why This is Dumb

- Trying to control the ecosystem by taking the deals from talent agencies and running through their own sales.
	- Twitch's Media Buy Minimum is VERY HIGH
		- If you want to activate or do anything, you have to pay a lot more to get started. Which makes no sense for these companies
		- Twitch can not manage all of these deals.
			- Twitch Sales Team, Twitch in General is unprofitable & is bleeding employees as a result of Amazon layoffs.
