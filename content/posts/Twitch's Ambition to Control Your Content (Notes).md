## Updated Branded Content Guidelines | What Are the Changes?

1. Branded Content Disclosure Tool
	1. Not bad just an FCC requirement, it's a better tool that helps creators disclose advertisements whether they're sponsored or not.
2. Permitted and Prohibited Brand Sponsors
	1. Logos on stream can be **AT MAX** 3% of the screen
	2. No "burned in" video ads
		1. This is massive since most large content creators or events will have burned in ads.
	3. No burned in audio ads (same as above, pretty much?)
3. **Prohibited** Branded content categories
	1. Hateful products or Services
	2. Gambling content
	3. Scams
	4. Adult oriented services
	5. Weapons
	6. Tobacco
	7. ICO, PayPal loans, rich quick schemes
	8. Political content
	9. cannabis-related products
