Hello there! My name is Hayden, but you may know me online as [LightMind](https://twitter.com/ItsLightMind).

My aim with this Public Digital Garden is to provide resources that can help others expand their knowledge on some topics that i've looked into. Presently, I've published just one article, a look through into the statements and publicly available music policies of 22 Game Studios/Publishers. You can read it here [Game Soundtrack Policies](/posts/game-soundtrack-policies)

Additionally, there's a subsidiary page linked to that article, titled [Individual Claimed Music Tracks](/posts/individual-claimed-music-tracks) where you'll find a list of background music tracks that have been flagged for copyright. While I don't anticipate this page gaining immediate popularity—since it relies on user submissions—I encourage you to contribute. If you encounter a song that wasn't cleared for use because of Content ID, please [send me a screenshot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/itslightmind), so I can add it to the list, so others know what games/series might be off the table.

> A quick note, just to be clear:  
> This is a community resource designed to inform about tracks that have previously been claimed. It is not a definitive guide. Always approach the use of game music on a case-by-case basis, consulting the game developer and publisher directly. Policies on music use can change at any time, leaving us all in a bind.
