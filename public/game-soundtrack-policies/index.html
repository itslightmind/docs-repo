Bungie, Inc ❌ 📄 Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed, wouldn’t recommend.. Seems like they hold the right to change the rules at any point, hopefully not retroactively Players may create videos using Destiny gameplay, which may be uploaded to third party sharing services like YouTube. If a chosen video-on-demand service enables players to monetize content, 20% of the content within the video must have been created by the player.

So keep that in mind. This happened in 2021. Copyright claim on Hollow Knight video : r/HollowKnight Hyper Light Drifter (Heart Machine) ❌ 📄 didn’t see anything from them at all for music usage, sadly no one has questioned/asked at least from my research. People have gotten away with uploading complete OST’s and singles for the last 8 years Vignette: Corruption - Hyper Light Drifter OST - YouTube Hyper Light Drifter - Complete OST - YouTube Hyper Light Drifter Opening Cinematic (High Definition) - YouTube Wild Frost, StarBound (Chucklefish) ✅ 📄 Monetization on YouTube/Twitch Is Allowed They say “please” include a buy link for the game in the description on the Starbound FAQ, but not the Wildfrost FAQ.

Cant find any modern copyright policies from the studio, but it seems like they’re open for at least they’re own gameplay packages, so it might not work for using the music out of context. “The Smite studio has issued a statement on YouTube streaming and monetization. “We support and encourage you, as an individual content creator, to create videos using our game content AND monetize those videos as you wish,” the developer writes. Additionally, it has offered to provide written backup to any streamer that finds their videos improperly claimed.” This statement is from 2013
